Mr.Sniffles had set out on a very fine day, it was Tuesday, the best day of
the week...according to Mr.Sniffles. Nothing ever bothered Mr.Sniffles on a
Tuesday, something about the way the day would develop, and how it compared
to the other days of the week. It was just the very best all-aroun there was 
something symmetrical about it..
