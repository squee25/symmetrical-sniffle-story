Mr.Sniffles had set out on a very fine day, it was Tuesday, the best day of
the week...according to Mr.Sniffles. Nothing ever bothered Mr.Sniffles on a
Tuesday, something about the way the day would develop, and how it compared
to the other days of the week. It was just the very best all-around there was 
something symmetrical about it..  

Mr. Sniffles liked symmetrical things. He liked circles and squares and other
symmetrical shapes. He liked symmetrical number patterns, and he liked 
symmetrical words. And this Tuesday, he decided, was an extra special day.

Mr.Sniffles decided that he was going to take a trip to Maidson, Wisconsin. He got into his car and sped down the highway. Once Mr. Sniffles made it to Madison, he parked his car at The Wisconsin State Capitol.

Where his car was ticketed and towed because he left it there too long. Poor Mr.Sniffles.
